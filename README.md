## Instructions

The Matching Game application will allow the user to flip cards in order to find
a matching set.  Once a match is made, the matching cards are disabled.  Once all
cards are matched, a modal will appear displaying the game's statistics:  
time played, number of moves, and total score (by star rating).  

A reset button also allows for a game to be restarted, reshuffling the cards and 
estarting the timer, once the first pair of cards is clicked. 

## Learnings

Working the Project Memory Game for the Udacity Front End Developemnt has taught me
how to put disparate learnings of javascript into a cohesive, working, interactive 
website.  I had to utilize HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to complete this task.
